Overall Structure:
C# code can only see other code written within the same class by default.

Functions
First, the function must be placed outside of the Main function, but still inside the Program class.
C# does not support embedding of functions so the new function we add must be separate.
    Once built however the new function can be run by calling its name inside the Main 
    function and passing in the necessary input.

Public vs Private
Public functions are avaiable to any part of the program that can see it.
Private can only be called from within the same scope as the definition. 

Static
Static function can be called within the scope of its definition or by calling it on the class it's defined in.
A non-static method has to be called on an instance of an object. 

Void
Void is a keyword that signifies that the function has no return. 
If we want to return something, put the type there.

Checks memory location:
A.Equals(B) with A and B being the respective variables

String interpolation
Console.WriteLine($"The value of 2 + 2 is {1+3}")

Type Conversion
Explicit casting:
    int num = 2;
    float numAsFloat = (float)num
    // Value equals 2.0
Explicit casting with built method: 
    int num = 2;
    string numToString = num.ToString();
    //Value equals "2"
